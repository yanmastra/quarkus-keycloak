# Practicing to build Microservices with Quarkus, Quarkus-extension, Keycloak, and SSL integrated
This project was created to practice building Microservices with Quarkus, Securing services with Keycloak and testing the performance of hibernate-orm and hibernate-reactive.
In this project, there is a sample of the Rest-API project that contains many samples of Endpoint classes and samples of hibernate queries, etc.
If you are interested, let's see a couple of documentation below.
